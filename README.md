## Dependencies
    python 3.7
    pandas
    numpy
    scipy
    networkx
    python-louvian 

## Setup
1. Make sure to have dependencies installed
2. Clone our repository `https://github.com/biomac-lab/Epidemiology_behavior_dynamics.git`
3. Create networks
4. Simulate (may take a lot of time!)
5. Generate figures

## Usage

### Creation of networks using *networkx*


### Run simulations



##### For running simulations over a scale-free network with 1000 nodes in both information transmission scheme (as shown in the paper)

##### For running simulations over a scale-free network with 5000 nodes in both infomation transmission scheme (as shown in the paper)

 
##### For running simulations over a small-world and grid network with 1000 nodes in both infomation transmission scheme (as shown in the paper)


##### For running simulations over a ODE (as shown in the paper)


#### Simulation for cluster analysis


##### For for saving the checkpoint of the simulations executed over a scale-free network with 5000 nodes in both infomation transmission scheme (as shown in the paper)

### Figures generation

#### Networks visualization


#### Heatmaps visualization


#### Disease and behavior dynamics over networks


#### Clustered dynamics over a scale-free network
